    <p>Kimchi is a popular Korean fermented cabbage dish that's spicy and slightly sweet. I spent a year in South Korea and fell in love with kimchi!</p>

    <ul>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <li>2 heads of napa cabbage</li>
        <li>1+1/4 cups coarse sea salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
        <li>5 green onions chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 small white onion, minced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, pressed</li>
        <li>1 teasppon ground ginger </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons  white sugar</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons gochugaru</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <li>Cut cabbages in half lengthwise and trim the ends. Rinse and cut into pieces about 2 inch square. Place cabbage into large resealable bags; sprinkle salt evenly over leaves to coat. Use your hands to rub salt into cabbage. Seal the bags and leave at room temperature for 6 hours.</li>
        <li>Rinse cabbage leaves under cold water, at least 2 to 3 times, to remove most of the salt; drain and squeeze out any excess liquid. </li>
        <li>Place rinsed cabbage in a large container with a tight fitting lid. Stir in fish sauce, green onions, white onion, garlic, sugar, and ginger. Sprinkle Korean chile powder over mixture.; wear plastic gloves to protect your hands and rub chile powder into cabbage leaves until evenly coated. </li>
        <li>Seal the container and set in a cool dry place. Leave undisturbed for 4 days. Refrigerate before serving, and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 month (if it lasts that long!). </li>
        
    </ol>
